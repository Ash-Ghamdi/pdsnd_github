### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
1. Python script file.
2. CSV files provided by Motivate for three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
